# Welcome
This site is going to be for my non-work related ramblings. I get to do a lot of cool stuff at work, but I don't get to talk about it.

## About me
I've had a lot of careers but the two main ones are:
1. Management Accountant with a focus on budgeting and forecasting and systems (I'm a member of CIMA)
2. Data Scientist, I did an MSc in business analytics at Imperial. Currently my work is in engineering.

## What to expect
I'm going to write predominantly about:
1. Data Science/Analytics and how I'm using it
2. Why and when of data science from an accountancy/decision making perspective
3. Misc professional stuff (rarely)
